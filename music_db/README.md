## Purpose

To practise integrating both web application and api under same project, several features experimented/implemented:

1. Customize routes for both API and web application, making it more readable for user;
2. Customize the data in API (JSON file);
3. Create Artist, Album and Song controllers/models/views.

## Motivation

Build an API for web application.
